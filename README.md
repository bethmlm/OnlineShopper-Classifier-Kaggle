# OnlineShopper-Classifier-Kaggle
Binary classification using machine learning models to predict whether an online shopper will spend money on a website

Jupyter Notebook

Goal: build a classification model that will predict whether a shopper is a paying customer based on the available features (10 numerical and 7 categorical features, not including the "revenue" category).

Basic steps will involve: data cleaning -> data exploration -> model pipeline -> model examination -> data exploration again

The data were downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/roshansharma/online-shoppers-intention) and the explanation of the features can be found on there.
